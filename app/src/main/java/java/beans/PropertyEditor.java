/**
 * A PropertyEditor class provides support for GUIs that want to allow users to
 * edit a property value of a given type.
 * <p>
 * PropertyEditor supports a variety of different kinds of ways of displaying
 * and updating property values. Most PropertyEditors will only need to support
 * a subset of the different options available in this API.
 * <p>
 * Simple PropertyEditors may only support the getAsText and setAsText methods
 * and need not support (say) paintValue or getCustomEditor. More complex types
 * may be unable to support getAsText and setAsText but will instead support
 * paintValue and getCustomEditor.
 * <p>
 * Every propertyEditor must support one or more of the three simple display
 * styles. Thus it can either (1) support isPaintable or (2) both return a
 * non-null String[] from getTags() and return a non-null value from getAsText
 * or (3) simply return a non-null String from getAsText().
 * <p>
 * Every property editor must support a call on setValue when the argument
 * object is of the type for which this is the corresponding propertyEditor. In
 * addition, each property editor must either support a custom editor, or
 * support setAsText.
 * <p>
 * Each PropertyEditor should have a null constructor.
