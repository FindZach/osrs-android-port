/**
 * The ComponentOrientation class encapsulates the language-sensitive
 * orientation that is to be used to order the elements of a component or of
 * text. It is used to reflect the differences in this ordering between Western
 * alphabets, Middle Eastern (such as Hebrew), and Far Eastern (such as
 * Japanese).
 * <p>
 * Fundamentally, this governs items (such as characters) which are laid out in
 * lines, with the lines then laid out in a block. This also applies to items in
 * a widget: for example, in a check box where the box is positioned relative to
 * the text.
 * <p>
 * There are four different orientations used in modern languages as in the
 * following table.<br>
 *
 * <pre>
 * LT          RT          TL          TR
 * A B C       C B A       A D G       G D A
 * D E F       F E D       B E H       H E B
 * G H I       I H G       C F I       I F C
 * </pre>
 *
 * <br>
 * (In the header, the two-letter abbreviation represents the item direction in
 * the first letter, and the line direction in the second. For example, LT means
 * "items left-to-right, lines top-to-bottom", TL means "items top-to-bottom,
 * lines left-to-right", and so on.)
 * <p>
 * The orientations are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>LT - Western Europe (optional for Japanese, Chinese, Korean)
 * <li>RT - Middle East (Arabic, Hebrew)
 * <li>TR - Japanese, Chinese, Korean
 * <li>TL - Mongolian
 * </ul>
 * Components whose view and controller code depends on orientation should use
 * the <code>isLeftToRight()</code> and <code>isHorizontal()</code> methods to
 * determine their behavior. They should not include switch-like code that keys
 * off of the constants, such as:
 *
 * <pre>
 * if (orientation == LEFT_TO_RIGHT) {
 *   ...
 * } else if (orientation == RIGHT_TO_LEFT) {
 *   ...
 * } else {
 *   // Oops
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This is unsafe, since more constants may be added in the future and since it
 * is not guaranteed that orientation objects will be unique.
