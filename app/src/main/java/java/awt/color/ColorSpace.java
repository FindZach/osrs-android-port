/**
 * This abstract class is used to serve as a color space tag to identify the
 * specific color space of a Color object or, via a ColorModel object, of an
 * Image, a BufferedImage, or a GraphicsDevice. It contains methods that
 * transform colors in a specific color space to/from sRGB and to/from a
 * well-defined CIEXYZ color space.
 * <p>
 * For purposes of the methods in this class, colors are represented as arrays
 * of color components represented as floats in a normalized range defined by
 * each ColorSpace. For many ColorSpaces (e.g. sRGB), this range is 0.0 to 1.0.
 * However, some ColorSpaces have components whose values have a different
 * range. Methods are provided to inquire per component minimum and maximum
 * normalized values.
 * <p>
 * Several variables are defined for purposes of referring to color space types
 * (e.g. TYPE_RGB, TYPE_XYZ, etc.) and to refer to specific color spaces (e.g.
 * CS_sRGB and CS_CIEXYZ). sRGB is a proposed standard RGB color space. For more
 * information, see
 * <A href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Graphics/Color/sRGB.html">
 * http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Graphics/Color/sRGB.html </A>.
 * <p>
 * The purpose of the methods to transform to/from the well-defined CIEXYZ color
 * space is to support conversions between any two color spaces at a reasonably
 * high degree of accuracy. It is expected that particular implementations of
 * subclasses of ColorSpace (e.g. ICC_ColorSpace) will support high performance
 * conversion based on underlying platform color management systems.
 * <p>
 * The CS_CIEXYZ space used by the toCIEXYZ/fromCIEXYZ methods can be described
 * as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 *
 * &nbsp;     CIEXYZ
 * &nbsp;     viewing illuminance: 200 lux
 * &nbsp;     viewing white point: CIE D50
 * &nbsp;     media white point: "that of a perfectly reflecting diffuser" -- D50
 * &nbsp;     media black point: 0 lux or 0 Reflectance
 * &nbsp;     flare: 1 percent
 * &nbsp;     surround: 20percent of the media white point
 * &nbsp;     media description: reflection print (i.e., RLAB, Hunt viewing media)
 * &nbsp;     note: For developers creating an ICC profile for this conversion
 * &nbsp;           space, the following is applicable.  Use a simple Von Kries
 * &nbsp;           white point adaptation folded into the 3X3 matrix parameters
 * &nbsp;           and fold the flare and surround effects into the three
 * &nbsp;           one-dimensional lookup tables (assuming one uses the minimal
 * &nbsp;           model for monitors).
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
