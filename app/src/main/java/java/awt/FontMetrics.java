/**
 * The <code>FontMetrics</code> class defines a font metrics object, which
 * encapsulates information about the rendering of a particular font on a
 * particular screen.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note to subclassers</b>: Since many of these methods form closed, mutually
 * recursive loops, you must take care that you implement at least one of the
 * methods in each such loop to prevent infinite recursion when your subclass is
 * used. In particular, the following is the minimal suggested set of methods to
 * override in order to ensure correctness and prevent infinite recursion
 * (though other subsets are equally feasible):
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #getAscent()}
 * <li>{@link #getLeading()}
 * <li>{@link #getMaxAdvance()}
 * <li>{@link #charWidth(char)}
 * <li>{@link #charsWidth(char[], int, int)}
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <img src="doc-files/FontMetrics-1.gif" alt="The letter 'p' showing its
 * 'reference point'" border=15 align ALIGN=right HSPACE=10 VSPACE=7> Note that
 * the implementations of these methods are inefficient, so they are usually
 * overridden with more efficient toolkit-specific implementations.
 * <p>
 * When an application asks to place a character at the position
 * (<i>x</i>,&nbsp;<i>y</i>), the character is placed so that its reference
 * point (shown as the dot in the accompanying image) is put at that position.
 * The reference point specifies a horizontal line called the <i>baseline</i> of
 * the character. In normal printing, the baselines of characters should align.
 * <p>
 * In addition, every character in a font has an <i>ascent</i>, a
 * <i>descent</i>, and an <i>advance width</i>. The ascent is the amount by
 * which the character ascends above the baseline. The descent is the amount by
 * which the character descends below the baseline. The advance width indicates
 * the position at which AWT should place the next character.
 * <p>
 * An array of characters or a string can also have an ascent, a descent, and an
 * advance width. The ascent of the array is the maximum ascent of any character
 * in the array. The descent is the maximum descent of any character in the
 * array. The advance width is the sum of the advance widths of each of the
 * characters in the character array. The advance of a <code>String</code> is
 * the distance along the baseline of the <code>String</code>. This distance is
 * the width that should be used for centering or right-aligning the
 * <code>String</code>.
 * <p>
 * Note that the advance of a <code>String</code> is not necessarily the sum of
 * the advances of its characters measured in isolation because the width of a
 * character can vary depending on its context. For example, in Arabic text, the
 * shape of a character can change in order to connect to other characters.
 * Also, in some scripts, certain character sequences can be represented by a
 * single shape, called a <em>ligature</em>. Measuring characters individually
 * does not account for these transformations.
 * <p>
 * Font metrics are baseline-relative, meaning that they are generally
 * independent of the rotation applied to the font (modulo possible grid hinting
 * effects). See {@link java.awt.Font Font}.
