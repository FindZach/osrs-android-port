/**
 * The <code>DropTargetListener</code> interface is the callback interface used
 * by the <code>DropTarget</code> class to provide notification of DnD
 * operations that involve the subject <code>DropTarget</code>. Methods of this
 * interface may be implemented to provide "drag under" visual feedback to the
 * user throughout the Drag and Drop operation.
 * <p>
 * Create a listener object by implementing the interface and then register it
 * with a <code>DropTarget</code>. When the drag enters, moves over, or exits
 * the operable part of the drop site for that <code>DropTarget</code>, when the
 * drop action changes, and when the drop occurs, the relevant method in the
 * listener object is invoked, and the <code>DropTargetEvent</code> is passed to
 * it.
 * <p>
 * The operable part of the drop site for the <code>DropTarget</code> is the
 * part of the associated <code>Component</code>'s geometry that is not obscured
 * by an overlapping top-level window or by another <code>Component</code>
 * higher in the Z-order that has an associated active <code>DropTarget</code>.
 * <p>
 * During the drag, the data associated with the current drag operation can be
 * retrieved by calling <code>getTransferable()</code> on
 * <code>DropTargetDragEvent</code> instances passed to the listener's methods.
 * <p>
 * Note that <code>getTransferable()</code> on the
 * <code>DropTargetDragEvent</code> instance should only be called within the
 * respective listener's method and all the necessary data should be retrieved
 * from the returned <code>Transferable</code> before that method returns.
