/**
 * The <code>DragSourceDragEvent</code> is delivered from the
 * <code>DragSourceContextPeer</code>, via the <code>DragSourceContext</code>,
 * to the <code>DragSourceListener</code> registered with that
 * <code>DragSourceContext</code> and with its associated
 * <code>DragSource</code>.
 * <p>
 * The <code>DragSourceDragEvent</code> reports the <i>target drop action</i>
 * and the <i>user drop action</i> that reflect the current state of the drag
 * operation.
 * <p>
 * <i>Target drop action</i> is one of <code>DnDConstants</code> that represents
 * the drop action selected by the current drop target if this drop action is
 * supported by the drag source or <code>DnDConstants.ACTION_NONE</code> if this
 * drop action is not supported by the drag source.
 * <p>
 * <i>User drop action</i> depends on the drop actions supported by the drag
 * source and the drop action selected by the user. The user can select a drop
 * action by pressing modifier keys during the drag operation:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   Ctrl + Shift -> ACTION_LINK
 *   Ctrl         -> ACTION_COPY
 *   Shift        -> ACTION_MOVE
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * If the user selects a drop action, the <i>user drop action</i> is one of
 * <code>DnDConstants</code> that represents the selected drop action if this
 * drop action is supported by the drag source or
 * <code>DnDConstants.ACTION_NONE</code> if this drop action is not supported by
 * the drag source.
 * <p>
 * If the user doesn't select a drop action, the set of
 * <code>DnDConstants</code> that represents the set of drop actions supported
 * by the drag source is searched for <code>DnDConstants.ACTION_MOVE</code>,
 * then for <code>DnDConstants.ACTION_COPY</code>, then for
 * <code>DnDConstants.ACTION_LINK</code> and the <i>user drop action</i> is the
 * first constant found. If no constant is found the <i>user drop action</i> is
 * <code>DnDConstants.ACTION_NONE</code>.
