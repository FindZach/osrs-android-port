/**
 * The root event class for all AWT events. This class and its subclasses
 * supercede the original java.awt.Event class. Subclasses of this root AWTEvent
 * class defined outside of the java.awt.event package should define event ID
 * values greater than the value defined by RESERVED_ID_MAX.
 * <p>
 * The event masks defined in this class are needed by Component subclasses
 * which are using Component.enableEvents() to select for event types not
 * selected by registered listeners. If a listener is registered on a component,
 * the appropriate event mask is already set internally by the component.
 * <p>
 * The masks are also used to specify to which types of events an
 * AWTEventListener should listen. The masks are bitwise-ORed together and
 * passed to Toolkit.addAWTEventListener.
