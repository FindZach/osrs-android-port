/**
 * The <code>BasicStroke</code> class defines a basic set of rendering
 * attributes for the outlines of graphics primitives, which are rendered with a
 * {@link Graphics2D} object that has its Stroke attribute set to this
 * <code>BasicStroke</code>. The rendering attributes defined by
 * <code>BasicStroke</code> describe the shape of the mark made by a pen drawn
 * along the outline of a {@link Shape} and the decorations applied at the ends
 * and joins of path segments of the <code>Shape</code>. These rendering
 * attributes include: <dl compact>
 * <dt><i>width</i>
 * <dd>The pen width, measured perpendicularly to the pen trajectory.
 * <dt><i>end caps</i>
 * <dd>The decoration applied to the ends of unclosed subpaths and dash
 * segments. Subpaths that start and end on the same point are still considered
 * unclosed if they do not have a CLOSE segment. See
 * {@link java.awt.geom.PathIterator#SEG_CLOSE SEG_CLOSE} for more information
 * on the CLOSE segment. The three different decorations are: {@link #CAP_BUTT},
 * {@link #CAP_ROUND}, and {@link #CAP_SQUARE}.
 * <dt><i>line joins</i>
 * <dd>The decoration applied at the intersection of two path segments and at
 * the intersection of the endpoints of a subpath that is closed using
 * {@link java.awt.geom.PathIterator#SEG_CLOSE SEG_CLOSE}. The three different
 * decorations are: {@link #JOIN_BEVEL}, {@link #JOIN_MITER}, and
 * {@link #JOIN_ROUND}.
 * <dt><i>miter limit</i>
 * <dd>The limit to trim a line join that has a JOIN_MITER decoration. A line
 * join is trimmed when the ratio of miter length to stroke width is greater
 * than the miterlimit value. The miter length is the diagonal length of the
 * miter, which is the distance between the inside corner and the outside corner
 * of the intersection. The smaller the angle formed by two line segments, the
 * longer the miter length and the sharper the angle of intersection. The
 * default miterlimit value of 10.0f causes all angles less than 11 degrees to
 * be trimmed. Trimming miters converts the decoration of the line join to
 * bevel.
 * <dt><i>dash attributes</i>
 * <dd>The definition of how to make a dash pattern by alternating between
 * opaque and transparent sections.
 * </dl>
 * All attributes that specify measurements and distances controlling the shape
 * of the returned outline are measured in the same coordinate system as the
 * original unstroked <code>Shape</code> argument. When a
 * <code>Graphics2D</code> object uses a <code>Stroke</code> object to redefine
 * a path during the execution of one of its <code>draw</code> methods, the
 * geometry is supplied in its original form before the <code>Graphics2D</code>
 * transform attribute is applied. Therefore, attributes such as the pen width
 * are interpreted in the user space coordinate system of the
 * <code>Graphics2D</code> object and are subject to the scaling and shearing
 * effects of the user-space-to-device-space transform in that particular
 * <code>Graphics2D</code>. For example, the width of a rendered shape's outline
 * is determined not only by the width attribute of this
 * <code>BasicStroke</code>, but also by the transform attribute of the
 * <code>Graphics2D</code> object. Consider this code: <blockquote><tt>
 * // sets the Graphics2D object's Tranform attribute
 * g2d.scale(10, 10);
 * // sets the Graphics2D object's Stroke attribute
 * g2d.setStroke(new BasicStroke(1.5f));
 * </tt></blockquote> Assuming there are no other scaling transforms added to
 * the <code>Graphics2D</code> object, the resulting line will be approximately
 * 15 pixels wide. As the example code demonstrates, a floating-point line
 * offers better precision, especially when large transforms are used with a
 * <code>Graphics2D</code> object. When a line is diagonal, the exact width
 * depends on how the rendering pipeline chooses which pixels to fill as it
 * traces the theoretical widened outline. The choice of which pixels to turn on
 * is affected by the antialiasing attribute because the antialiasing rendering
 * pipeline can choose to color partially-covered pixels.
 * <p>
 * For more information on the user space coordinate system and the rendering
 * process, see the <code>Graphics2D</code> class comments.
