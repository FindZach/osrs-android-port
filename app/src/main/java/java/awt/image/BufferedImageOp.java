/**
 * This interface describes single-input/single-output operations performed on
 * <CODE>BufferedImage</CODE> objects. It is implemented by
 * <CODE>AffineTransformOp</CODE>, <CODE>ConvolveOp</CODE>,
 * <CODE>ColorConvertOp</CODE>, <CODE>RescaleOp</CODE>, and
 * <CODE>LookupOp</CODE>. These objects can be passed into a
 * <CODE>BufferedImageFilter</CODE> to operate on a <CODE>BufferedImage</CODE>
 * in the ImageProducer-ImageFilter-ImageConsumer paradigm.
 * <p>
 * Classes that implement this interface must specify whether or not they allow
 * in-place filtering-- filter operations where the source object is equal to
 * the destination object.
 * <p>
 * This interface cannot be used to describe more sophisticated operations such
 * as those that take multiple sources. Note that this restriction also means
 * that the values of the destination pixels prior to the operation are not used
 * as input to the filter operation.
