/**
 * WriteableRenderedImage is a common interface for objects which contain or can
 * produce image data in the form of Rasters and which can be modified and/or
 * written over. The image data may be stored/produced as a single tile or a
 * regular array of tiles.
 * <p>
 * WritableRenderedImage provides notification to other interested objects when
 * a tile is checked out for writing (via the getWritableTile method) and when
 * the last writer of a particular tile relinquishes its access (via a call to
 * releaseWritableTile). Additionally, it allows any caller to determine whether
 * any tiles are currently checked out (via hasTileWriters), and to obtain a
 * list of such tiles (via getWritableTileIndices, in the form of a Vector of
 * Point objects).
 * <p>
 * Objects wishing to be notified of changes in tile writability must implement
 * the TileObserver interface, and are added by a call to addTileObserver.
 * Multiple calls to addTileObserver for the same object will result in multiple
 * notifications. An existing observer may reduce its notifications by calling
 * removeTileObserver; if the observer had no notifications the operation is a
 * no-op.
 * <p>
 * It is necessary for a WritableRenderedImage to ensure that notifications
 * occur only when the first writer acquires a tile and the last writer releases
 * it.
