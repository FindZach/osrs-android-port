/**
 * A RenderableImage is a common interface for rendering-independent images (a
 * notion which subsumes resolution independence). That is, images which are
 * described and have operations applied to them independent of any specific
 * rendering of the image. For example, a RenderableImage can be rotated and
 * cropped in resolution-independent terms. Then, it can be rendered for various
 * specific contexts, such as a draft preview, a high-quality screen display, or
 * a printer, each in an optimal fashion.
 *
 * <p>
 * A RenderedImage is returned from a RenderableImage via the createRendering()
 * method, which takes a RenderContext. The RenderContext specifies how the
 * RenderedImage should be constructed. Note that it is not possible to extract
 * pixels directly from a RenderableImage.
 *
 * <p>
 * The createDefaultRendering() and createScaledRendering() methods are
 * convenience methods that construct an appropriate RenderContext internally.
 * All of the rendering methods may return a reference to a previously produced
 * rendering.
