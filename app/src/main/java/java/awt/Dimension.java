/**
 * The <code>Dimension</code> class encapsulates the width and height of a
 * component (in integer precision) in a single object. The class is associated
 * with certain properties of components. Several methods defined by the
 * <code>Component</code> class and the <code>LayoutManager</code> interface
 * return a <code>Dimension</code> object.
 * <p>
 * Normally the values of <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are
 * non-negative integers. The constructors that allow you to create a dimension
 * do not prevent you from setting a negative value for these properties. If the
 * value of <code>width</code> or <code>height</code> is negative, the behavior
 * of some methods defined by other objects is undefined.
