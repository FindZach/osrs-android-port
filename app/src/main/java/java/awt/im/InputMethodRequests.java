/**
 * InputMethodRequests defines the requests that a text editing component has to
 * handle in order to work with input methods. The component can implement this
 * interface itself or use a separate object that implements it. The object
 * implementing this interface must be returned from the component's
 * getInputMethodRequests method.
 *
 * <p>
 * The text editing component also has to provide an input method event
 * listener.
 *
 * <p>
 * The interface is designed to support one of two input user interfaces:
 * <ul>
 * <li><em>on-the-spot</em> input, where the composed text is displayed as part
 * of the text component's text body.
 * <li><em>below-the-spot</em> input, where the composed text is displayed in a
 * separate composition window just below the insertion point where the text
 * will be inserted when it is committed. Note that, if text is selected within
 * the component's text body, this text will be replaced by the committed text
 * upon commitment; therefore it is not considered part of the context that the
 * text is input into.
 * </ul>
