/**
 * The <code>FontRenderContext</code> class is a container for the information
 * needed to correctly measure text. The measurement of text can vary because of
 * rules that map outlines to pixels, and rendering hints provided by an
 * application.
 * <p>
 * One such piece of information is a transform that scales typographical points
 * to pixels. (A point is defined to be exactly 1/72 of an inch, which is
 * slightly different than the traditional mechanical measurement of a point.) A
 * character that is rendered at 12pt on a 600dpi device might have a different
 * size than the same character rendered at 12pt on a 72dpi device because of
 * such factors as rounding to pixel boundaries and hints that the font designer
 * may have specified.
 * <p>
 * Anti-aliasing and Fractional-metrics specified by an application can also
 * affect the size of a character because of rounding to pixel boundaries.
 * <p>
 * Typically, instances of <code>FontRenderContext</code> are obtained from a
 * {@link java.awt.Graphics2D Graphics2D} object. A
 * <code>FontRenderContext</code> which is directly constructed will most likely
 * not represent any actual graphics device, and may lead to unexpected or
 * incorrect results.
