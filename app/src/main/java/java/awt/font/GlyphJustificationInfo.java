/**
 * The <code>GlyphJustificationInfo</code> class represents information about
 * the justification properties of a glyph. A glyph is the visual representation
 * of one or more characters. Many different glyphs can be used to represent a
 * single character or combination of characters. The four justification
 * properties represented by <code>GlyphJustificationInfo</code> are weight,
 * priority, absorb and limit.
 * <p>
 * Weight is the overall 'weight' of the glyph in the line. Generally it is
 * proportional to the size of the font. Glyphs with larger weight are allocated
 * a correspondingly larger amount of the change in space.
 * <p>
 * Priority determines the justification phase in which this glyph is used. All
 * glyphs of the same priority are examined before glyphs of the next priority.
 * If all the change in space can be allocated to these glyphs without exceeding
 * their limits, then glyphs of the next priority are not examined. There are
 * four priorities, kashida, whitespace, interchar, and none. KASHIDA is the
 * first priority examined. NONE is the last priority examined.
 * <p>
 * Absorb determines whether a glyph absorbs all change in space. Within a given
 * priority, some glyphs may absorb all the change in space. If any of these
 * glyphs are present, no glyphs of later priority are examined.
 * <p>
 * Limit determines the maximum or minimum amount by which the glyph can change.
 * Left and right sides of the glyph can have different limits.
 * <p>
 * Each <code>GlyphJustificationInfo</code> represents two sets of metrics,
 * which are <i>growing</i> and <i>shrinking</i>. Growing metrics are used when
 * the glyphs on a line are to be spread apart to fit a larger width. Shrinking
 * metrics are used when the glyphs are to be moved together to fit a smaller
 * width.
