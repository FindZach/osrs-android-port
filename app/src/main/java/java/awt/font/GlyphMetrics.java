/**
 * The <code>GlyphMetrics</code> class represents infomation for a single glyph.
 * A glyph is the visual representation of one or more characters. Many
 * different glyphs can be used to represent a single character or combination
 * of characters. <code>GlyphMetrics</code> instances are produced by
 * {@link java.awt.Font Font} and are applicable to a specific glyph in a
 * particular <code>Font</code>.
 * <p>
 * Glyphs are either STANDARD, LIGATURE, COMBINING, or COMPONENT.
 * <ul>
 * <li>STANDARD glyphs are commonly used to represent single characters.
 * <li>LIGATURE glyphs are used to represent sequences of characters.
 * <li>COMPONENT glyphs in a {@link GlyphVector} do not correspond to a
 * particular character in a text model. Instead, COMPONENT glyphs are added for
 * typographical reasons, such as Arabic justification.
 * <li>COMBINING glyphs embellish STANDARD or LIGATURE glyphs, such as accent
 * marks. Carets do not appear before COMBINING glyphs.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Other metrics available through <code>GlyphMetrics</code> are the components
 * of the advance, the visual bounds, and the left and right side bearings.
 * <p>
 * Glyphs for a rotated font, or obtained from a <code>GlyphVector</code> which
 * has applied a rotation to the glyph, can have advances that contain both X
 * and Y components. Usually the advance only has one component.
 * <p>
 * The advance of a glyph is the distance from the glyph's origin to the origin
 * of the next glyph along the baseline, which is either vertical or horizontal.
 * Note that, in a <code>GlyphVector</code>, the distance from a glyph to its
 * following glyph might not be the glyph's advance, because of kerning or other
 * positioning adjustments.
 * <p>
 * The bounds is the smallest rectangle that completely contains the outline of
 * the glyph. The bounds rectangle is relative to the glyph's origin. The
 * left-side bearing is the distance from the glyph origin to the left of its
 * bounds rectangle. If the left-side bearing is negative, part of the glyph is
 * drawn to the left of its origin. The right-side bearing is the distance from
 * the right side of the bounds rectangle to the next glyph origin (the origin
 * plus the advance). If negative, part of the glyph is drawn to the right of
 * the next glyph's origin. Note that the bounds does not necessarily enclose
 * all the pixels affected when rendering the glyph, because of rasterization
 * and pixel adjustment effects.
 * <p>
 * Although instances of <code>GlyphMetrics</code> can be directly constructed,
 * they are almost always obtained from a <code>GlyphVector</code>. Once
 * constructed, <code>GlyphMetrics</code> objects are immutable.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Example</strong>:
 * <p>
 * Querying a <code>Font</code> for glyph information <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>
 * Font font = ...;
 * int glyphIndex = ...;
 * GlyphMetrics metrics = GlyphVector.getGlyphMetrics(glyphIndex);
 * int isStandard = metrics.isStandard();
 * float glyphAdvance = metrics.getAdvance();
 * </pre>
 *
 * </blockquote>
