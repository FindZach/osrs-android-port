/**
 * EventDispatchThread is a package-private AWT class which takes events off the
 * EventQueue and dispatches them to the appropriate AWT components.
 * <p>
 * The Thread starts a "permanent" event pump with a call to
 * pumpEvents(Conditional) in its run() method. Event handlers can choose to
 * block this event pump at any time, but should start a new pump (<b>not</b> a
 * new EventDispatchThread) by again calling pumpEvents(Conditional). This
 * secondary event pump will exit automatically as soon as the Condtional
 * evaluate()s to false and an additional Event is pumped and dispatched.
