/**
 * A helper interface to run the nested event loop.
 * <p>
 * Objects that implement this interface are created with the
 * {@link EventQueue#createSecondaryLoop} method. The interface provides two
 * methods, {@link #enter} and {@link #exit}, which can be used to start and
 * stop the event loop.
 * <p>
 * When the {@link #enter} method is called, the current thread is blocked until
 * the loop is terminated by the {@link #exit} method. Also, a new event loop is
 * started on the event dispatch thread, which may or may not be the current
 * thread. The loop can be terminated on any thread by calling its {@link #exit}
 * method. After the loop is terminated, the {@code SecondaryLoop} object can be
 * reused to run a new nested event loop.
 * <p>
 * A typical use case of applying this interface is AWT and Swing modal dialogs.
 * When a modal dialog is shown on the event dispatch thread, it enters a new
 * secondary loop. Later, when the dialog is hidden or disposed, it exits the
 * loop, and the thread continues its execution.
 * <p>
 * The following example illustrates a simple use case of secondary loops:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   SecondaryLoop loop;
 *
 *   JButton jButton = new JButton("Button");
 *   jButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
 *       {@code @Override}
 *       public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
 *           Toolkit tk = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit();
 *           EventQueue eq = tk.getSystemEventQueue();
 *           loop = eq.createSecondaryLoop();
 *
 *           // Spawn a new thread to do the work
 *           Thread worker = new WorkerThread();
 *           worker.start();
 *
 *           // Enter the loop to block the current event
 *           // handler, but leave UI responsive
 *           if (!loop.enter()) {
 *               // Report an error
 *           }
 *       }
 *   });
 *
 *   class WorkerThread extends Thread {
 *       {@code @Override}
 *       public void run() {
 *           // Perform calculations
 *           doSomethingUseful();
 *
 *           // Exit the loop
 *           loop.exit();
 *       }
 *   }
 * </pre>
