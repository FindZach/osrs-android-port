/**
 * The <code>PathIterator</code> interface provides the mechanism for objects
 * that implement the {@link java.awt.Shape Shape} interface to return the
 * geometry of their boundary by allowing a caller to retrieve the path of that
 * boundary a segment at a time. This interface allows these objects to retrieve
 * the path of their boundary a segment at a time by using 1st through 3rd order
 * B&eacute;zier curves, which are lines and quadratic or cubic B&eacute;zier
 * splines.
 * <p>
 * Multiple subpaths can be expressed by using a "MOVETO" segment to create a
 * discontinuity in the geometry to move from the end of one subpath to the
 * beginning of the next.
 * <p>
 * Each subpath can be closed manually by ending the last segment in the subpath
 * on the same coordinate as the beginning "MOVETO" segment for that subpath or
 * by using a "CLOSE" segment to append a line segment from the last point back
 * to the first. Be aware that manually closing an outline as opposed to using a
 * "CLOSE" segment to close the path might result in different line style
 * decorations being used at the end points of the subpath. For example, the
 * {@link java.awt.BasicStroke BasicStroke} object uses a line "JOIN" decoration
 * to connect the first and last points if a "CLOSE" segment is encountered,
 * whereas simply ending the path on the same coordinate as the beginning
 * coordinate results in line "CAP" decorations being used at the ends.
