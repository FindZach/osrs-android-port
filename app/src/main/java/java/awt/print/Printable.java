/**
 * The <code>Printable</code> interface is implemented by the <code>print</code>
 * methods of the current page painter, which is called by the printing system
 * to render a page. When building a {@link Pageable}, pairs of
 * {@link PageFormat} instances and instances that implement this interface are
 * used to describe each page. The instance implementing <code>Printable</code>
 * is called to print the page's graphics.
 * <p>
 * A <code>Printable(..)</code> may be set on a <code>PrinterJob</code>. When
 * the client subsequently initiates printing by calling
 * <code>PrinterJob.print(..)</code> control
 * <p>
 * is handed to the printing system until all pages have been printed. It does
 * this by calling <code>Printable.print(..)</code> until all pages in the
 * document have been printed. In using the <code>Printable</code> interface the
 * printing commits to image the contents of a page whenever requested by the
 * printing system.
 * <p>
 * The parameters to <code>Printable.print(..)</code> include a
 * <code>PageFormat</code> which describes the printable area of the page,
 * needed for calculating the contents that will fit the page, and the page
 * index, which specifies the zero-based print stream index of the requested
 * page.
 * <p>
 * For correct printing behaviour, the following points should be observed:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The printing system may request a page index more than once. On each
 * occasion equal PageFormat parameters will be supplied.
 *
 * <li>The printing system will call <code>Printable.print(..)</code> with page
 * indexes which increase monotonically, although as noted above, the
 * <code>Printable</code> should expect multiple calls for a page index and that
 * page indexes may be skipped, when page ranges are specified by the client, or
 * by a user through a print dialog.
 *
 * <li>If multiple collated copies of a document are requested, and the printer
 * cannot natively support this, then the document may be imaged multiple times.
 * Printing will start each copy from the lowest print stream page index page.
 *
 * <li>With the exception of re-imaging an entire document for multiple collated
 * copies, the increasing page index order means that when page N is requested
 * if a client needs to calculate page break position, it may safely discard any
 * state related to pages < N, and make current that for page N. "State" usually
 * is just the calculated position in the document that corresponds to the start
 * of the page.
 *
 * <li>When called by the printing system the <code>Printable</code> must
 * inspect and honour the supplied PageFormat parameter as well as the page
 * index. The format of the page to be drawn is specified by the supplied
 * PageFormat. The size, orientation and imageable area of the page is therefore
 * already determined and rendering must be within this imageable area. This is
 * key to correct printing behaviour, and it has the implication that the client
 * has the responsibility of tracking what content belongs on the specified
 * page.
 *
 * <li>When the <code>Printable</code> is obtained from a client-supplied
 * <code>Pageable</code> then the client may provide different PageFormats for
 * each page index. Calculations of page breaks must account for this.
 * </ul>
