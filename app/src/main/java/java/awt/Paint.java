/**
 * This <code>Paint</code> interface defines how color patterns can be generated
 * for {@link Graphics2D} operations. A class implementing the
 * <code>Paint</code> interface is added to the <code>Graphics2D</code> context
 * in order to define the color pattern used by the <code>draw</code> and
 * <code>fill</code> methods.
 * <p>
 * Instances of classes implementing <code>Paint</code> must be read-only
 * because the <code>Graphics2D</code> does not clone these objects when they
 * are set as an attribute with the <code>setPaint</code> method or when the
 * <code>Graphics2D</code> object is itself cloned.
