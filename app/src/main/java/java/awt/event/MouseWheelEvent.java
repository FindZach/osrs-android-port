/**
 * An event which indicates that the mouse wheel was rotated in a component.
 * <p>
 * A wheel mouse is a mouse which has a wheel in place of the middle button.
 * This wheel can be rotated towards or away from the user. Mouse wheels are
 * most often used for scrolling, though other uses are possible.
 * <p>
 * A MouseWheelEvent object is passed to every <code>MouseWheelListener</code>
 * object which registered to receive the "interesting" mouse events using the
 * component's <code>addMouseWheelListener</code> method. Each such listener
 * object gets a <code>MouseEvent</code> containing the mouse event.
 * <p>
 * Due to the mouse wheel's special relationship to scrolling Components,
 * MouseWheelEvents are delivered somewhat differently than other MouseEvents.
 * This is because while other MouseEvents usually affect a change on the
 * Component directly under the mouse cursor (for instance, when clicking a
 * button), MouseWheelEvents often have an effect away from the mouse cursor
 * (moving the wheel while over a Component inside a ScrollPane should scroll
 * one of the Scrollbars on the ScrollPane).
 * <p>
 * MouseWheelEvents start delivery from the Component underneath the mouse
 * cursor. If MouseWheelEvents are not enabled on the Component, the event is
 * delivered to the first ancestor Container with MouseWheelEvents enabled. This
 * will usually be a ScrollPane with wheel scrolling enabled. The source
 * Component and x,y coordinates will be relative to the event's final
 * destination (the ScrollPane). This allows a complex GUI to be installed
 * without modification into a ScrollPane, and for all MouseWheelEvents to be
 * delivered to the ScrollPane for scrolling.
 * <p>
 * Some AWT Components are implemented using native widgets which display their
 * own scrollbars and handle their own scrolling. The particular Components for
 * which this is true will vary from platform to platform. When the mouse wheel
 * is moved over one of these Components, the event is delivered straight to the
 * native widget, and not propagated to ancestors.
 * <p>
 * Platforms offer customization of the amount of scrolling that should take
 * place when the mouse wheel is moved. The two most common settings are to
 * scroll a certain number of "units" (commonly lines of text in a text-based
 * component) or an entire "block" (similar to page-up/page-down). The
 * MouseWheelEvent offers methods for conforming to the underlying platform
 * settings. These platform settings can be changed at any time by the user.
 * MouseWheelEvents reflect the most recent settings.
 * <p>
 * The <code>MouseWheelEvent</code> class includes methods for getting the
 * number of "clicks" by which the mouse wheel is rotated. The
 * {@link #getWheelRotation} method returns the integer number of "clicks"
 * corresponding to the number of notches by which the wheel was rotated. In
 * addition to this method, the <code>MouseWheelEvent</code> class provides the
 * {@link #getPreciseWheelRotation} method which returns a double number of
 * "clicks" in case a partial rotation occurred. The
 * {@link #getPreciseWheelRotation} method is useful if a mouse supports a
 * high-resolution wheel, such as a freely rotating wheel with no notches.
 * Applications can benefit by using this method to process mouse wheel events
 * more precisely, and thus, making visual perception smoother.
