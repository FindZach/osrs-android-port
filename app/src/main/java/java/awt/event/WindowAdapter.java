/**
 * An abstract adapter class for receiving window events. The methods in this
 * class are empty. This class exists as convenience for creating listener
 * objects.
 * <p>
 * Extend this class to create a <code>WindowEvent</code> listener and override
 * the methods for the events of interest. (If you implement the
 * <code>WindowListener</code> interface, you have to define all of the methods
 * in it. This abstract class defines null methods for them all, so you can only
 * have to define methods for events you care about.)
 * <p>
 * Create a listener object using the extended class and then register it with a
 * Window using the window's <code>addWindowListener</code> method. When the
 * window's status changes by virtue of being opened, closed, activated or
 * deactivated, iconified or deiconified, the relevant method in the listener
 * object is invoked, and the <code>WindowEvent</code> is passed to it.
