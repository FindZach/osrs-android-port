/**
 * Input method events contain information about text that is being composed
 * using an input method. Whenever the text changes, the input method sends an
 * event. If the text component that's currently using the input method is an
 * active client, the event is dispatched to that component. Otherwise, it is
 * dispatched to a separate composition window.
 *
 * <p>
 * The text included with the input method event consists of two parts:
 * committed text and composed text. Either part may be empty. The two parts
 * together replace any uncommitted composed text sent in previous events, or
 * the currently selected committed text. Committed text should be integrated
 * into the text component's persistent data, it will not be sent again.
 * Composed text may be sent repeatedly, with changes to reflect the user's
 * editing operations. Committed text always precedes composed text.
